# react-base
A react base for personal projects. 

Based (mostly) on the Medium article by Fancois Ward (https://medium.com/@fward/state-of-the-art-javascript-in-2016-ab67fc68eb0b#.3o0nhzpg3)

TL;DR - here are the article's favored components (could easily get this from the package.json file as well)
   * Core library: React
   * Application life cycle: Redux
   * Language: ES6 with Babel. No types (yet) -- bobse: I'm sneaking some in...
   * Linting & style: ESLint with AirBNB
   * Dependency management: It’s all about NPM, CommonJS and ES6 modules
   * Build tool: Webpack
   * Testing: Mocha + Chai + Sinon (but it’s not that simple) -- bobse: I'm probably going to go with jasmine
   * Utility library: Lodash is king, but look at Ramda -- bobse: lodash all the way!!!
   * Http requests: Just use fetch!
   * Styling: Consider CSS modules -- bobse: I'll probably want to be a little more opinionated here
   * (Data) API: GraphQL/Relay & REST everywhere else
