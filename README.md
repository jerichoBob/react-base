# react-base
A react base for personal projects. 

Based (mostly) on the Medium article by Fancois Ward (https://medium.com/@fward/state-of-the-art-javascript-in-2016-ab67fc68eb0b#.3o0nhzpg3)

TL;DR - here are the article's favored components (could easily get this from the package.json file as well)
   * **Core Library**: [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) - (duh)
   * **Application life cycle**: [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
   * **Language: ES6 with Babel**. No types (yet) -- bobse: I'll sneak some in...
   * **Linting & style**: ESLint with AirBNB
   * **Dependency management**: It’s all about NPM, CommonJS and ES6 modules
   * **Build tool**: [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
   * **Testing**: [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) + [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) + [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) (but it’s not that simple) -- bobse: I'm probably going to go with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html)
   ** also need to add E2E testing! 
   * **Utility library**: [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
   * **Http requests**: [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) + [http-client](https://github.com/mjackson/http-client)
   * **Styling**: Consider CSS modules -- bobse: I'll probably want to be a little more opinionated here
   * **(Data) API**: [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html)/[Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html) & REST everywhere else
